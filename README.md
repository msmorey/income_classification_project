# Income Classification
Using Census Data to predict income level

## Goals

1. Explore the Census data.
2. Preprocess Census data for machine learning.
3. Add other data sources (as necessary).
4. Train an ML model to predict whether a citizen had an income above $50k.
5. Create an interface for users to learn about what factors influenced income levels in the mid 90s.

## Interface Design

Create some sort of visual thats fun to look at. Have that visual respond dynamically to user input from sliders, dropdowns, text boxes, etc. Have a randomization button to assign random values. Have some sort of conclusions area. Consider tracking historical inputs from users and graphing them somehow? 

## Tools

* VS Code
* Jupyter Notebooks
* .py files
* AWS (for hosting and API...?)
* Streamlit (for interface)
